# CS22101 - Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository contains my course materials for **CS22101 - Data Structures and Algorithms**. It includes lecture-wise notes, code implementations (in C++/Python), problem-solving practice, and visual references for important concepts like:

- Arrays, Linked Lists  
- Stacks and Queues  
- Trees and Graphs  
- Sorting and Searching Algorithms  
- Recursion, Divide & Conquer  
- Greedy, Dynamic Programming  
- Backtracking, Branch & Bound, NP-completeness  

> Ideal for revision, interview prep, or foundational DSA understanding.
